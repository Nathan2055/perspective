# Perspective

This is a single-method Python library for fetching Minecraft's assets from the post-1.6 Mojang CDN. It was intended for use with the original Python version of Moddle.

Documentation: directory is the destination directory, version is the asset definition to fetch, verbose is an optional argument which activates logging, and prefix is another optional argument to create a prefix for the logging (required for Moddle)
